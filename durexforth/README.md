# durexforth

Modern, lean C64 Forth inspired by colorForth, JONESFORTH and Blazin' Forth. Project includes a vi clone written in Forth, a high-resolution graphics library, plus MML music support (new in 1.3!).

Goals:

* Fun. The system should be nice to work with on the real machine.
* Simplicity. The core should be small, leaving a lot of space for user code and data.
* Speed. As it stands, durexForth is the fastest C64 Forth.
